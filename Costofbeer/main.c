/**
 * 12 - Ounce of beer
 * 
 * 365 - 1 year
 * 
 * 15 pounds of calorie gain in one year
 * from drinking 12 ounce of beer everyday.
 * 
 * beer-to-weight-gain = constant
 * 
 * Ask the user how many beers they expect to consume each day and also
 * the amount of money theyy spend on it.
 * 
 * Goal: Write a program to determine:
 * 1. How many beers will the user consume over the course of the year?
 * 2. Assuming a beer is 150 calories,
 *    how many calories will they take in from beer alone
 *    over the course of the year?
 * 3. How much weight can the user expect to gain in one year based
 *    on the number of 12-ounce beers they consume every day?
 * 4. How much the user will spend on beer this year?
 * 
 * All outputs should be 2 digits precision after the decimal point!
 * Assume a year is 365 days (ignore leap years).
 * 
 * Input specification
 * 1. The 12-ounces beers consumed each day will be a 
 *    non-negative number.
 * 2. The user can specify the brand of the beer and its price
 *    because its not all the same for all people.
